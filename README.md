drunken-shame
=============

A simplified gameplay only theme for Stepmania 5


The only screens in this theme are a short instruction screen and gameplay.
The instruction screen transitions to gameplay after 15 seconds of idle or pressing start.

Songs are chosen at random and rated by NPS only.
If you score under 90%, a song at least 1 NPS easier will be chosen next.
If you score over 98%, a song at least 1 NPS harder will be chosen next.
In between will stay the same.
Scoring is ITG scoring system.

Fail is turned off.  Stop using an empty life bar as excuse to wuss out of finishing a song.  There's not even a lifebar, so just smash arrows and forget about everything else.

On the gameplay screen, use g and h to adjust your speed mod in increments of 5.
Use f and j to adjust speed in increments of 100.
Use b to change you speed mod between C, M, and X modes.
Use c, v, n, and m to adjust notefield tilt (distant).
Use t and y to adjust mini in increments of 10%.
Use 1 to end playing and save your profile. (which will save your current speed mod, tilt, and mini settings.)
Use = to toggle these special keybindings on/off.
Edit these keys by editing the drunken_config.lua file in your profile.

If you prefer to play as player 2 instead of player 1, edit the Save/drunken_config.lua and change the player_number field.
